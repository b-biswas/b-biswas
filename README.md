### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [CPAC group](https://cpac.hep.anl.gov/) at Argonne National Laboratory. 

I am dedicated to developing algorithms for processing the data from the next generation of Cosmological Surveys.
In particular, as a member of the [DESC Collaboration](lsstdesc.org), my scientific interest is to unravel the mysteries of dark energy with the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera Rubin Observatory, primarily focusing on probes like cosmic shear.
