### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. student a the APC laboratory in Paris and I work on developing machine learning algorithms to deal with the massive volume and complexity of cosmological data.

Most of my time is devoted to research within the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC), the key highlight being developing a new ML-based deblender to separate galaxies that overlap in images.
