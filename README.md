### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [CPAC group](https://cpac.hep.anl.gov/) at Argonne National Laboratory. 

I work at the forefront of unraveling the mysteries of dark energy with the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera Rubin Observatory, primarily focusing on probes like cosmic shear.
